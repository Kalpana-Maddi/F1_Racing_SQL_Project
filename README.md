# F1_Racing_SQL_Project
## üèé Formula 1 Racing SQL Analysis

### üìå Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing Formula 1 race data using **MySQL**. It simulates a real-world data analysis workflow ‚Äî from answering basic questions to creating advanced analytical queries ‚Äî all aimed at uncovering performance trends, driver statistics, and race insights.

The dataset (`f1_racing`) contains information such as:

* **Driver Names**
* **Race Positions & Grid Start Positions**
* **Weather Conditions**
* **Lap Times & Points**
* **Team Associations**
* **Penalties**
* **Season**

The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL proficiency in:

* Filtering and grouping data
* Using aggregate functions for summary statistics
* Applying **window functions** for ranking
* Using **CTEs** for complex analysis
* Combining multiple conditions to answer analytical business questions

### üìä Summary of Insights

#### **Basic Analysis**

* Identified all unique drivers participating in the dataset.
* Measured **races completed without penalties**, with *Lando Norris* and *Charles Leclerc* leading the list.
* Discovered that **Cloudy weather** is most associated with race wins.
* Observed correlations between **grid start positions** and average finishing positions.
* Found that *Lewis Hamilton* had the **fastest average lap time** under rainy conditions.

#### **Advanced Analysis**

* Ranked drivers by **average finishing position** among top 10 finishes, with *Lando Norris* performing the best.
* Found that *Max Verstappen*, *Charles Leclerc*, and *Lando Norris* finished in the top 5 in more than **25% of their races**.
* Generated **seasonal driver rankings**, identifying the top 3 drivers for each year.
* Tracked **year-over-year performance improvements** for specific drivers.
* Calculated **average points per driver per team**, focusing on those who have raced for more than one team.
If you want, I can also add a **"Project Structure"** and **"How to Run"** section so your README feels complete and professional. That would make it look more like a polished portfolio piece. Would you like me to do that?
